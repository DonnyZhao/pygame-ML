# Pygame Machine Learning
Machine learning applied to Pygame games.

## Description
This toolapplies Machine Learning to be able to play autonomously to some little Pygame games. Before the algorithm is able to play autonomously, user should train it playing a few minutes.
Here, you can see an example of the algorithm playing to the currently implemented games:
* Pong (Trained with 1600 rows of data)
  
  Left player is controlled by IA.

* Racing Game (Trained with 16000 rows of data)

This tool doesnÂ´t use raw pixels for making its predictions. Instead, it uses internal game data:
* Player position
* Other players position
* Ball position
* etc.

## Usage

The code has been tested with **Python 3.6**, it should work with every 3.x Python version.

* Install pygame, scipy and bigml (if using BigML ML engine)

```
pip install pygame
```

```
pip install scipy
```

```
pip install bigml
```
* Open Main Window
```
python main.py
```
* If using BigML engine, put your username and API key in **config.py** file.
* Choose a game and train it. Needed training time depends on the game
    * Pong - Between 500 and 2500 rows is fine
    * Racing - Between 5000 and 30000 rows is fine

* After playing it, press **(q)** to stop playing and start creating and training the model
  
  **It will take between 1 and 4 minutes to do it.**

* Choose a game and press **Auto play**

## Machine Learning Engines

### BigML
Currently, there is only one Machine Learning engine implemented, [BigML](https://bigml.com/).
You have to create a free account, and get your API key.

## TO DO
- [x] Racing Game
- [ ] Avoid blocking game screen while training
- [ ] New ML engine: Scikit-learn
- [ ] New ML engine: Keras
- [ ] New game: Tetris
